class Startup
#### Build the following methods on the `Startup` class
=begin
- `Startup#name`
  - returns a **string** that is the startup's name
- `Startup#founder`
  - returns a **string** that is the founder's name
  - Once a startup is created, the founder cannot be changed.
- `Startup#domain`
  - returns a **string** that is the startup's domain
  - Once a startup is created, the domain cannot be changed 
  (ie. A developer working with instances of the Startup class cannot directly 
  change the domain)
- `Startup#pivot`
  - given a string of a **domain** and a string of a **name**, 
  change the domain and name of the startup. 
  This is the only public method through which the domain can be changed.
- `Startup.all`
  - should return **all** of the startup instances
- `Startup.find_by_founder`
  - given a string of a **founder's name**, returns the **first startup** whose founder's name matches
- `Startup.domains`
  - should return an **array** of all of the different startup domains
